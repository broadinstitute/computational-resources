# Installing Python

Here we review how to install Python, using either [python.org](python.org), 
[anaconda.com](anaconda.com), or Homebrew.

## Motivation

MacOS comes with a built in Python version, however relying on this as your primary Python installation is 
problematic since:

1. The installation is managed by the operating system, so if you upgrade you may 
lose all of your installed packages

2. You may prefer a different version of Python that's either more up to date or compatible with 
a specific version of Python required for an analysis

## Installing from python.org

Visit [python.org/downloads](python.org/downloads) and click on the download button.
