# Welcome to GPP R&D's Computational Resource

This project is an introduction and reference
to analyzing biological data. The repository is organized into 
four sections: Introduction, Data Analysis, Screen Analysis, and Additional Topics. Within
each section there are modules for learning about one aspect of data analysis. The modules are 
organized in order, so if this is your first time through the repository, we suggest you 
start in section one, module one - Shell Commands. 

This project is written and maintained by the R&D
group in the Genetic Perturbation Platform. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, 
please create an issue here on GitHub. 

Based on feedback and ideas for new modules we will periodically update this repository.
All updates will be tracked below. You can reference older versions of this repository by checking
out a different release or older commit on GitHub.
