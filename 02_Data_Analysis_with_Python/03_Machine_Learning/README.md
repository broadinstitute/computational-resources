# Machine Learning

Activate your virtual environment if you haven't yet

```shell
yourname@something ~ % source ~/base_analysis/bin/activate
```

`cd` to the Machine_Learning folder and open the Visualization_Packages notebook

```shell
(base_analysis) yourname@something ~ % jupyter-lab Machine_Learning.ipynb
```

Note that you may need to change the notebook kernel to ensure you have all required packages.
